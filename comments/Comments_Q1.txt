part a.)

    delta_xk = (xk+1 âˆ’ xk) represents the intervals between consecutive years.

    f[xk, xk+1] represents the slope between consecutive years.

part b.)

    For the system to converge using the Gauss-Seidel method, the coefficient matrix must be
    a square matrix of size n x n. the right-hand-side vector must be the same dimensions as
    A meaning it must have the same number of rows, (n,:) or (n x m). The initial guess for
    the solution must also be the same dimension as A, (n,:) or (n x m). The system created in a.)
    does satisfy these requirements. The system is guaranteed a converging solution if the
    matrix A is strictly diagonally dominant and is symmetric (A = A^T). The system could
    possibly converge if the previous condition isn't met but is not guaranteed if
    the solutions over multiple iterations starts decreasing the convergence is possible.

part e.)

    The data point in 2015 seems to deviate strongly off the interpolated function compared to the
    other points. Due to this, the interpolated function may not be accurately representing
    the CO2 concentration in March 2015.
